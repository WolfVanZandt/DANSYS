# DANSYS
A data analysis spreadsheet built using LibreOffice Calc.
DANSYS is a collection of Calc macros that provide a powerful suite of data analysis procedures that can be accessed from a Libreoffice spreadsheet. I have no beta testing group, so I would appreciate any suggestions for how to improve the package and notice of any bugs that I have left un-exterminated.
DANSYSX is an ongoing expansion of DANSYS. Version 1.0 includes crosstabulation functions, a suite of combinatorics functions, and other random additions including a program language (Code) that can be used directly on a spreadsheet to provide looping and branching capabilities.
User manuals are also available.
